The Odin Project: Cloning the Google Homepage

-Purpose:

At the end of this porject I intend to master my skills in HTML and CSS to some degree that I'd like to be able to copy any webpage that I see on the web using both conventional HTML/CSS methods and using google developer tools.

-Tools:

The Odin Project Website: theodinproject.com

Google itself: google.com

Almighty GitHub": github.com

Visual Studio Code

Google Chrome and Developer Tools that come with it

Lastly and more importantly, HTML and CSS

Update 1:

-Created the repository itlself, created this README.md file and added the purpose.
-Created the index.html and style.css files and styles folder for css.

Update 1.2:

-Added the Google logo at the center of the page as a div in a parent div. 
-Fixed the parent div at the middle of the page so that everything I place inside this div will go directly to the middle (check .searchbar class in style.css).
-Created a search bar and a search button (check div class=search in index.html), set the border for it to 3px and tried to get as close to the original Google searchbar color as possible. Deleted the border on the right to stick the search button to the search bar seamlessly.
-Set the padding (space around the search text) to 5px and searchbox height to 10px since that felt the closest to Google's original setting. (check .search css for more info)
-Tried to make the searchbox a circle by setting top and left radii to 16px.
-Added a Google Voice Search logo as search button, however neither regular nor the voice search will be non-functional for this project and they stay there as placeholders.
